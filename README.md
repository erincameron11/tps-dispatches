### Introduction
Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are a crucial part of urban infrastructure, ensuring that critical care reaches those in need as fast as possible. In this analysis, I explore Toronto Paramedic Services (TPS) dispatch data to understand where ambulances are most frequently deployed, and whether patterns emerge based on location and time.

Using Python and geospatial visualization techniques, I dive into the data to uncover trends that could help optimize emergency response strategies.

### Data Exploration
The dataset consists of ambulance dispatch records, each containing details such as general location, timestamp, and dispatch priority. The goal is to map these locations and examine patterns across different time periods.
